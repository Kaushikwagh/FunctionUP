Assignment 01
  Q. Write a program for calculators in java which performs addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of any two numbers. Take user input using Scanner class and print the results      of every calculation.

Assignment 02 
  Q.Q) Write a program in java that - 1) Prompts the user to enter their name, age, and whether they are a student or not. 2) It then reads the input using the Scanner class with       
        appropriate data types (String, int, and boolean). 3) Based on the user's age, it determines if they are an adult or a minor, and based on their student status, it provides a 
        relevant message. (eg: You are eligible to be a student etc). Note: Try to use your own method / functions to print messages.

Assignment 03
  Certainly, here are four basic coding problems related to the topics -:

  Problem 1: Simple If-Else Statement
  Write a program that asks the user for their age using `Scanner`. If the age is greater than or equal to 18, print "You are an adult." Otherwise, print "You are a minor."

  Problem 2: If-Else If-Else Block
  Create a program that takes an integer input from the user and determines if it's positive, negative, or zero. Display an appropriate message.

  Problem 3: Logical Operators
  Write a program that prompts the user for a number. Check if the number is both even and greater than 10. If both conditions are met, print "The number is even and greater than 10."

  Problem 4: Comparing Strings
  Ask the user to enter their favorite color using `Scanner`. If the input is "blue," print "Blue is a cool color." Otherwise, print "Your favorite color is nice too!"
  These problems introduce the basics of decision-making in code, including if-else statements, logical operators, and string comparisons, making them suitable for beginners.

Assignment 04 - Based On Loops
  Here are five very basic coding problems related to loops and the modulo operator:

  Problem 1: Simple While Loop
  Write a program that uses a `while` loop to print numbers from 1 to 5.

  Problem 2: Simple For Loop
  Create a program that uses a `for` loop to print the even numbers from 2 to 10.

  Problem 3: Simple Do-While Loop
  Write a program that uses a `do-while` loop to repeatedly ask the user for a number until they enter 0. After the loop, print the sum of all the entered numbers.

  Problem 4: Break Statement
  Modify the previous program with a `while` loop to stop asking for numbers if the user enters a negative number. Calculate and print the sum of all non-negative numbers entered.

  Problem 5: Modulo Operator
  Write a program that asks the user for an integer and checks if it's even or odd using the modulo operator (%). Display whether the number is even or odd.

  These problems are designed to introduce beginners to loops and the modulo operator in a simple and straightforward manner.
