  Assignment 01
    Q. Write a program for calculators in java which performs addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of any two numbers. Take user input using Scanner class and print the results      of every calculation.
  
  Assignment 02 
    Q.Q) Write a program in java that - 1) Prompts the user to enter their name, age, and whether they are a student or not. 2) It then reads the input using the Scanner class with       
          appropriate data types (String, int, and boolean). 3) Based on the user's age, it determines if they are an adult or a minor, and based on their student status, it provides a 
          relevant message. (eg: You are eligible to be a student etc). Note: Try to use your own method / functions to print messages.
  
  Assignment 03
    Certainly, here are four basic coding problems related to the topics -:
  
    Problem 1: Simple If-Else Statement
    Write a program that asks the user for their age using `Scanner`. If the age is greater than or equal to 18, print "You are an adult." Otherwise, print "You are a minor."
  
    Problem 2: If-Else If-Else Block
    Create a program that takes an integer input from the user and determines if it's positive, negative, or zero. Display an appropriate message.
  
    Problem 3: Logical Operators
    Write a program that prompts the user for a number. Check if the number is both even and greater than 10. If both conditions are met, print "The number is even and greater than 10."
  
    Problem 4: Comparing Strings
    Ask the user to enter their favorite color using `Scanner`. If the input is "blue," print "Blue is a cool color." Otherwise, print "Your favorite color is nice too!"
    These problems introduce the basics of decision-making in code, including if-else statements, logical operators, and string comparisons, making them suitable for beginners.
  
  Assignment 04 - Based On Loops
    Here are five very basic coding problems related to loops and the modulo operator:
  
    Problem 1: Simple While Loop
    Write a program that uses a `while` loop to print numbers from 1 to 5.
  
    Problem 2: Simple For Loop
    Create a program that uses a `for` loop to print the even numbers from 2 to 10.
  
    Problem 3: Simple Do-While Loop
    Write a program that uses a `do-while` loop to repeatedly ask the user for a number until they enter 0. After the loop, print the sum of all the entered numbers.
  
    Problem 4: Break Statement
    Modify the previous program with a `while` loop to stop asking for numbers if the user enters a negative number. Calculate and print the sum of all non-negative numbers entered.
  
    Problem 5: Modulo Operator
    Write a program that asks the user for an integer and checks if it's even or odd using the modulo operator (%). Display whether the number is even or odd.
  
    These problems are designed to introduce beginners to loops and the modulo operator in a simple and straightforward manner.
  
  Assignment 05 - Method Based Assignment
  
    Problem 1: Swapping Two Numbers
    Write a Java program that defines a method called swapNumbers that takes two integer variables as input and swaps their values. Call this method from the main method and print the values   of the variables before and after the swap.
    
    Problem 2: Finding the Maximum Element
    Write a Java program that defines a method called findMax that takes an array of integers as input and returns the maximum element in the array. Call this method from the main method and   print the maximum value.
    
    Problem 3: Check if a Number is Prime
    Write a Java program that defines a method called isPrime that takes an integer as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the number is prime or not. A prime number is a      positive integer greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. Call this method from the main method and print whether a given number is prime or not.
    
  Assignment 06 -  
    Problem 01 - https://www.codewars.com/kata/544675c6f971f7399a000e79/train/java
               - String to integer
  
    Problem 02 - https://www.codewars.com/kata/5715eaedb436cf5606000381/train/java
               - Sum of positive
               - You get an array of numbers, return the sum of all of the positives ones.
               - Example [1,-4,7,12] => 1 + 7 + 12 = 20
               - Note: if there is nothing to sum, the sum is default to 0.
               - ARRAYS-FUNDAMENTALS
  
    Problem 03 - https://www.codewars.com/kata/555a67db74814aa4ee0001b5/train/java
               - In this Kata we are passing a number (n) into a function.
               - Your code will determine if the number passed is even (or not).
               - The function needs to return either a true or false.
               - Numbers may be positive or negative, integers or floats.
               - Floats with decimal part non equal to zero are considered UNeven for this kata.
  
  Assignment 07 - 
              Problem 1: String Manipulation
              - Write a Java program that takes a user input string and then performs the following operations:
                Print the length of the string.
                Convert the string to uppercase and print it.
                Check if the string contains the word "Java" (case-insensitive) and print "Contains 'Java'" or "Does not contain 'Java'" accordingly.
  
              Problem 2: Array Sum and Average
                Create an array of integers in Java. Calculate and print the sum of all the elements in the array. Then, calculate and print the average of the elements.
                
                
                Problem 3: Type Casting and Conditional Statements
                Write a Java program that takes a user input number (a floating-point number) and does the following:
                If the number is greater than or equal to 10, cast it to an integer and print "Integer part: [integer value]."
                If the number is less than 10, cast it to an integer and print "Rounded to the nearest integer: [integer value]."
                These problems will help you practice working with strings, arrays, type casting, conditional statements, and basic user input in Java.
